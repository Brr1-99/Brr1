						Hello there Internet ! I open myself to you as an 
						<b> electrical and industrial engineer </b>
						named Bruno.
					</p>
					<br/>
					<p>
						Native of Galicia ( Spain ) , I have been always interested in concepts such as numbers and algorithms ðŸ§® .
						That is why I enrolled myself on the engineer degree I mentioned earlier.
					</p>
					<br/>
					<p>
						Recently , I have decided to take a dive into the <i> mysteriuos </i> ðŸ‘», yet <span className='text-xl'> astonishing ðŸŽ‡ </span> world of programming.
					</p>
					<p>
						What I enjoy working most with is <span className='bg-cyan-500 p-1 rounded'>Python</span> . It was my first language and it brings a lot of memories.
					</p>
					<br/>
					<p>
						Nowadays, apart from improving the core structure of my code , studying <span className='bg-cyan-500 p-1 rounded'> JavaScript</span> is what eats most of my hours. Nevertheless, I am sure that it will be worth the try. 
					</p>

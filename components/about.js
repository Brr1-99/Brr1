						My name is Bruno RodrÃ­guez and I am an
						<b> automation and industrial electronics engineer </b>
						.
					</p>
					<br/>
					<p>
						Native of Galicia, Spain, I have been always interested in concepts such as numbers and algorithms ðŸ§®.
					</p>
					<br/>
					<p>
						Recently, I have decided to take a dive into the world of programming.
					</p>
					<p>
						What I enjoy working most with is <span className='bg-cyan-500 p-1 rounded'>Python</span>. It was my first language back in 2020 and it brings a lot of memories.
					</p>
					<br/>
					<p>
						Nowadays, apart from improving the core structure of my code, studying <span className='bg-cyan-500 p-1 rounded'> JavaScript</span> is what occupies most of my hours.
